# async-programming-day5-task2-Weather_Now_App

Dear Sir,

Please note for this task we have used API datas from free API sites, so some city and country name maybe not showing correctly. Supposed if we are a paid and premium user we can see full data. However I have checked many countries and cities current weather details using this application. it's working good.

Thank you for reading this message and seeing code and webpage.

Kind Regards,
